# Pourly

Pourly is a simple, fun, visually-interactive game to help the user learn & practice their coffee pour-over skills.

I started drinking coffee during the pandemic, and got into learning how to make and optimize pour-overs. I was also diving deeper into React, so it seemed like a fun project to combine everything into a game that not-only teaches & reinforces proper coffee techniques, but also proper React techniques, especially in regards to the challenges and opportunities of using React for UI, gameplay logic & scorekeeping.

Current Status: Basic gameplay & learning modes built, along with UI. Additional game logic still needs to be written (a better scoring algorithm), along with various bugs, interactions & performance improvements. Super fun to build & use, in exploring global variables and more complex experiences with React. I've also since given up coffee, so this is my fun way to still do pour-overs.

Note: This PWA is not optimized/usable on desktop. I'll update with desktop functionality when I get the time. In the meantime, just view the demo in mobile mode with the browser or just view it on your phone.

HTML, CSS, React, Redux, Firebase
